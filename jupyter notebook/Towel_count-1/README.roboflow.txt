The dataset includes 2637 images.
50_towel_counts are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -10 and +10 degrees
* Random shear of between -45째 to +45째 horizontally and -45째 to +45째 vertically
